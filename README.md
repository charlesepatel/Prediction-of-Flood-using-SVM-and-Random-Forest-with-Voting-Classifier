# Prediction-of-Flood-using-SVM-and-Random-Forest-with-Voting-Classifier
The aim of this project is to develop a flood prediction model which is real time. This could
be helpful in the areas where the flash flood occurs. This system takes the input as the rainfall
data all over the india process it using different machine learning models and the best model is
determined with the help of accuracy of different algorithms, which would help people prior,
save lives and also save lots of meteorological efforts
